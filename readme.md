# Clean Markup in Drupal 7
by Dan Montgomery (PandaEskimo)

## Repository Contents
- docroot (a full drupal site for examples)
- mysql-db.sql.gz (a sample demo database to go along with the repo)
- slides (the slides for the presentation, in reveal.js)

## Viewing the slides
Open slides/index.html

## Using the demo site
- Drop the files in docroot in your local host as desired, for example, with MAMP or in ~/Sites.
- Create a database (in MySQL and load the mysql-db.sql.gz file).
- Edit the docroot/sites/default/settings.php to point to your database.
